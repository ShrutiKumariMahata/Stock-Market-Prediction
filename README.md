# 📈 AI-Based Stock Market Prediction System  

The **AI-Based Stock Market Prediction System** is designed to analyze historical stock market data and predict future stock price trends using **Machine Learning and Deep Learning (LSTM)**.  
By leveraging time-series analysis, the system helps in understanding market behavior and forecasting future stock prices.

## 🔍 Problem Statement  

Stock prices are highly volatile and influenced by multiple external and internal factors such as economic indicators, company performance, and global events. Manual prediction is unreliable, hence an **automated ML-based prediction system** is required.
